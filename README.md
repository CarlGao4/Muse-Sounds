# Muse-Sounds
The Muse Sounds soundfont only for research purpose

### Why this repo
The Muse Sounds library was released along with MuseScore Studio 4 and is a very high-quality soundfont. However, the library can only be used in MuseScore Studio 4 as it is distributed under internal format and could only be rendered with the "MuseSamplerCoreLib" (Actually, you can use Muse Sounds as long as you can load the MuseSampler API, which is undocumented but you can retrieve it by reading MuseScore Studio source code). This audio backend is not perfect yet, like it doesn't support per-note velocity. So converting the internal format into general soundfont formats without causing quality loss is the mission of this project.
