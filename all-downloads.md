# All Downloads

All files uploaded to the server are listed here. If you don't know what to download, you should check the [converted releases](instruments.md) first.

These files may be the original files, which may be non-standard formats or have extra files that are not needed for most users.

We constantly update converted releases and add new instruments for better effects. If a download link is unavailable, please wait a moment and try again. We will not notify you of updates, so you could check last updated time from time to time and download the latest version.

For Chinese users: CloudFlare only has CDN nodes in Mainland China for business users. If your download speed is slow, you can manually change the domain name in the download link from `dl.muse-sounds.work` to `dl-cn.muse-sounds.work`, which may uses better CDN nodes and routing. However, I don't guarantee it's faster.
