# Instrument List

If the previews can't be displayed on GitHub, please [click here](https://about.muse-sounds.work/instruments).

We constantly update converted releases and add new instruments for better effects. If a download link is unavailable, please wait a moment and try again. We will not notify you of updates, so you could check last updated time from time to time and download the latest version.

For Chinese users: CloudFlare only has CDN nodes in Mainland China for business users. If your download speed is slow, you can manually change the domain name in the download link from `dl.muse-sounds.work` to `dl-cn.muse-sounds.work`, which may uses better CDN nodes and routing. However, I don't guarantee it's faster.

## About File Types

- `*.sf2`: Converted SF2 format soundfont file.
- `*.sf3`: Converted SF3 format soundfont file.
- `*.sfz+flac.zip`: Converted SFZ files with FLAC audio files. You can use it directly in SFZ player.

## Converted Releases

These are the instruments that have been converted to standard formats so you can use them in your favorite software. There is no need to download extra files, just extract it (if it is archived) and load it. I've checked the SFZ, SF2, and SF3 files in MuseScore 3.6.2 and they work well.
